# SmartCow Assignment

## Task 1

I added a check for space, as it was not looking good if we have a card with space and if user enters multiple space then it was worse condition. Apart from this everything was fine in this task.
I added the link to task2 page in the side bar.

## Task 2

1. We could have added a background to the text and give a color to the text, then in all the images it would be readable.
2. We can use a library which calculates the average color of the image and accordingly we can set the font color for the text. 

I used fast-average-color library which calculates the average color of the image, and then I checked if the image is dark then I will have the font color as white otherwise black.
